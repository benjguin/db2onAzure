# Running tests

The tests we run are a set of SQL scripts to monitor the performance of the cluster.  
We run the queries from the Windows Client deployed in the infrastructure.

- [Prepare DB2 database](SQL/prepare/DB2.md)
- [Prepare test client](SQL/prepare/db2client_setup.md)

From the windows client, run the sql from the SQL folder script in order.
