Explanation: 

You need DB2 HA scripts to use SA MP with the DB2 HA feature.

These DB2 HA scripts are located at /usr/sbin/rsct/sapolicies/db2. The
database product installer detects whether these DB2 HA scripts need to
be installed or updated.

Configuration of instance "db2sdin1" succeeded on hosts "d0, cf0, cf1, d1"

The instance "db2sdin1" has been created successfully.

WARNING: DBI20167W  The DB2 pureScale instance was set to use the TCP/IP network protocol because the network is not configured for the RDMA network protocol.

The value "SVCENAME=db2c_db2sdin1" was set in the DBM CFG file for the
"db2sdin1" instance.

The value "DB2AUTOSTART=NO" was set in the Profile Registry for the "db2sdin1"
instance.

The shared file system cluster option 'usePersistentReserve' has not been set to the optimal value of 'yes'.  See the DB2 Information Center for more details.

Post-installation instructions 
-------------------------------

Required steps: 
The network monitor configuration file for the DB2 pureScale instance has been updated on each host to include the IP address of the hosts gateway. The configuration file /var/ct/cfg/netmon.cf was updated on the following hosts: "d0  d1 cf0 cf1". This file must be modified in the event of future changes to the hosts gateway IP address. Failing to configure /var/ct/cfg/netmon.cf correctly with a valid pingable gateway IP address will result in failures during instance startup.  For more details see sections "Setting up the netmon.cf file on a TCP/IP network" or "Setting up the netmon.cf file on a RoCE network" in the DB2 Information Center  based on the choice of your host network. 

Clients can connect to the DB2 pureScale instance "db2sdin1" through any DB2 member using the host name and the port number "50000". Record this information for future reference. 

Start using the DB2 product using a valid user ID such as the DB2 instance owner's ID "db2sdin1". 

Optional steps: 
The default database path in the database manager configuration (DFTDBPATH) is set to "/db2sd_1804a".   This is also the path to the instance shared directory in a shared file system.  DFTDBPATH can be updated to a new shared file system created using the db2cluster command (for example, db2cluster -cfs -create -filesystem fs-name).  For details on creating a shared file system, see the db2cluster command in the DB2 Information Center. 

Refer to "What's new" https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.wn.doc/doc/r0051514.html in the DB2 Information Center to learn about the new functions for DB2 V11.1. 

Open First Steps by running "db2fs" using a valid user ID such as the DB2 instance owner's ID. You will need to have DISPLAY set and a supported web browser in the path of this user ID. 

Ensure that you have the correct license entitlements for DB2 products and features installed on this machine. Each DB2 product or feature comes with a license certificate file (also referred to as a license key) that is distributed on an Activation CD, which also includes instructions for applying the license file. If you purchased a base DB2 product, as well as, separately priced features, you might need to install more than one license certificate. The Activation CD for your product or feature can be downloaded from Passport Advantage if it is not part of the physical media pack you received from IBM. For more information about licensing, search the Information Center (https://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.kc.doc/welcome.html) using terms such as "license compliance", "licensing" or "db2licm". 

To use your DB2 database product, you must have a valid license. For information about obtaining and applying DB2 license files, see http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.qb.server.doc/doc/c0061199.html.
